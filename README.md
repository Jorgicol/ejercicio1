Reinforcement learning (RL) can be applied to credit risk modeling by treating the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). The model can be trained to optimize a reward function that represents the overall performance of the credit risk model. The state space can include information about the borrower, such as their credit history, income, and debt, and the actions can represent different lending decisions, such as approving or denying a loan, or adjusting the interest rate. The model can be trained using techniques such as Q-learning or SARSA to learn the optimal policy for making lending decisions. Once trained, the model can be used to make real-time lending decisions, and can be continually updated as new data becomes available.
